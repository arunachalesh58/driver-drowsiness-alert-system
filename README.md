# driver-drowsiness-alert-system
This project implements a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) algorithm. It monitors the driver's eyes in real-time using a webcam, and triggers an alert via sound and push notification when drowsiness is detected. It uses OpenCV, dlib for facial landmarks, and Pushbullet for notifications.
